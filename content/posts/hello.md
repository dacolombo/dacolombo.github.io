I'm a Bioinformatics student at the University of Milan.

This is the place where I want to keep track of all of my University projects (and maybe others), so that I can have all of them in a single and organized place. I started this also with the intention to grasp a better understanding of how the web works and how to build a website.

Hope you can find something interesting or that can solve a problem you have when running a similar analysis to the ones I'll talk about here.

See you in the next project!
